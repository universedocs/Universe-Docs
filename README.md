Universe Documents (Universe Docs) (I've started this project from October 2018)

This project is partially done! Once completed it will benefit! 

## Introduction 

It is a WYSIWYG document editor, no code software, application store, document as a service, data repository, training tool, book library. Documents are created similar to how humans create information in brain. First document items (text, button, photo, video, link, upload, download, share, etc.,) are categorised/not categorised in brain. Then we use the already gathered document items in brain to create a document. When we get more information we do categorisation for those that is not done. If we do it fast then just jot it down without much thinking and later categorise it! 

## Screen Shots

### Document Item Document

Stores document items in natural and hierarchial order so that user can understand its nature! Document item is nothing but a unique text or photo or video or etc., Each document item can be associated with image, video, animation, document, etc., While searching for it in the document the user can add either text or photo or video or animation or document of a document item. The user can also import document items either in document or in document item document, from external source for example line of texts, set of images, CSV file, camera (image or video: use AI to recognize), speech (audio: use AI to recognise) etc., This document item document is opened when a user selects "Show Graph" from a document item in a document. For example "Trichy"! Can also search by category if you are not sure about an document item, after the result comes choose the respective document item from the document category by searching in it! 

![Document Item Document](https://github.com/universedocs/Universe-Docs/blob/master/Document%20Item%20Document.jpg)

### Document Item Search

Each document of specific type is associated with several document item documents. Those document items can be searched! When document items are indexed using an efficient search alogrithm then it will be fast search! For some items like field, we can automatically show it instead of asking user to search! For items like language grammars, can automatically add it there, instead of showing the search popup! So we can optimise it a lot no worries! But still if one feels the searching delays things, then can type all texts without searching (in urgent case by disabling searching) and later on we can parse the document using the provided document item documents for the document type and categorisation is done! We can use AI to do it perfectly or user need to manually confirm whether the categorisation is correct or not! Since the document item documents are specific to document the categorisation mostly should be accurate! 

![Document Item Search](https://github.com/universedocs/Universe-Docs/blob/master/Document%20Item%20Search.jpeg)

### Document Item Change

When user taps any document item the other document items of the same cateogry pops up and can change it! 

![Document Item Change](https://github.com/universedocs/Universe-Docs/blob/master/Document%20Item%20Change.jpg)

### Document Map Search

Can search the document map graph to locate the document in the library. No need to browse the documents figuring out where the document is! This is where all the training documents, filled forms, vector diagrams, shopping forms, school interactive books are searched and shown as categorised! 

![Document Map Search](https://github.com/universedocs/Universe-Docs/blob/master/Document%20Map%20Search.jpg)

### Food Recipe

Allows to edit here itself (WYSIWYG) and no need separate form to fill up those! Similarly all documents! Like this there can be large number of recipes for a collection. For example "Chettinad" collection! Since all the documents follow Graph model, each level is in different colour! The field name is in bold!

### Software Training Overview

This shows the overview document of the training and can purchase the training from here! Button is also a document item and not developed yet! Can also have button for contacting author! You should have noticed the texts are not in proper case and there is no proper space between texts and is resolvable!

### Software Training Introduction

This shows the introduction document! Like this there will be large number of documents! The user can select one or more documents or categories in a curriculum!You should have noticed the texts are not in proper case and there is no proper space between texts and is resolvable!

## Looks like a disadvantage but not like that

1. Since each document item or text is searched and added to the document, it will be slow. Our brain is designed to handle things slowly and it is better to do things slowly! We humans do everything fast and is a problem! It doesn't mean it is designed to delay user, but we can disable search, make the search faster using search alogrithms, indexing, etc.,
2. We need to devote time to cateogrise document items of each document, but the time we spend for it benefits us later! Categorisation also can be done later (disable document item search) so that documents can be created in urgent cases! Since the document is categorised it is easy to understand. It is used to get details of each document item from document itself! Categorisation can be made fast by using human like information gathering technologies like image recognition, speech recognition, video recognition, sound recognition, information search, AI, ML, etc.,
3. Editing interface uses text box to move between document items! Can customise the view to look like well known document editiors! I don't have time to do this! 

## Document can be presentable without duplicates (Hence a great training tool along with other features)

1. Each photo/video/animation/text/vector diagram can have childrens. 
      a) If photo have text-to-speech children's then the photo will remain in screen and the text-to-speech will run in background. Google Text-To-Speech supports large number of languages. 
      b) If photo have audio then the photo will remain in screen and the audio will be spoken
      c) If a vector diagram has children commands to highlight/animate/invoke action of a item and speak, then the vector diagram will remain in screen and the item will be highlighted/animated/invoked action and spoken.
2. Since the documents are separated in to parts we can easily combine to form a curriculum and do the presentation for it, in the order it is appearing in presentation collection.
3. Since the documents can be represented in multiple languages, the knowledge represented by the document can be known by all peoples regardless of language they speak. There are tools like Google Translate to do the job better, since it is already used to translate web page text languages.
3. We can get the screen shots (automatically by Universe Docs or through screen recording application) each steps of presentation and its audio to make video. Will help those who feel video is better. 
4. We can have templates if we want to have customised presentation screens. Refer the main document in the templates rather than duplicating it.
5. In the middle of presentation can look for graphical representation of a document item, translation of a document item, definition or details of a document item, etc.,
6. Can search and jump to a specific presentation item since the document is in graphical format.
7. Can attach documents like notes, source code, image, video, animation, etc., to document items
8. Can have a board to explain things in meeting using vector document. Just add the document item needed by searching. Use digital pencil to draw shapes and lines to explain things. For example you can use the document items of a training document to explain things in board. Since all the world knowledge can be put as document items, it is easy to explain anything in the board.


## How it compares to Google docs, Apple pages, microsoft word?

1. Each item (text, photo,etc.,) in the document are categorised and easy to parse, validate, filter, remote access/modify! For example by robot which is learning a recipe and modifies the document!
2. Each item (text, photo,etc.,) in the document are categorised while document is created / pre categorised, and no need extra processing by natural language processing!
3. The document follows a model. Graph is used for now. Later it can include any other model!
4. For deleting/copying a line/word/sentence/node just invoke a command no need to highlight and do it!
5. Avoids duplicates. Reusable document items! 
6. Provides service to manipulate documents from remote. For example a robot can manipulate document from distance or through wireless communcation!
7. Easy to find detials of each document items like description, further details, translations, meaning, hierarchy, etc., from the document itself! That details can be filtered based on specific document type!
8. Brings all documents and applications in central place like a book library, that is easy to search, interact between them and access
9. The document items can be used as a thing for changing the text in document to other one easily

## Web Browser Vs Universe Docs

| Serial Number | Web Browser | Universe Docs |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
|1|It was designed in 1990 and 30 years as gone. Designed based on the knowledge at that time and not changed much! They don't want to change much so that past internet contents are not affected! No Innovation for 30 years to make it close to the operating system!|It can change as per new innovations and is working close with operating system|
|2|It does not use the UI of the operating system, rather uses the content of the window as UI (drawing canvas or form)! It cannot use the other UI elements of an operating system for example toolbar, status bar! UI is not standard and encourages to have different UI for same type of application thereby spoiling the user experience and understanding! So many clicking of back and forward buttons and it is not natural! |Uses the UI of the operating system and closely works with it. Standard UI for each type of application and is human friendly!|
|3|The UI is not purely object oriented, rather mix of template and object oriented. Real world objects are object oriented and it is the proper way! |Purely object oriented! UI objects are represented as JSON and is mapped to programming language objects! |
|4|Web browser is not designed securely by default. Each web browser is following its own way! Due to the vulnerabilities it is the popular way to attack user by hackers!|The application is designed taking security into consideration and is managed by single entity but developed in cooperation with all peoples! |
|5|The client functionality and data is closely tied to web browser and not application. So the user need to do two steps to be safe: log out application, clear the browser cache. The application and user don't know what web browser configuration is set that creates security issue to the user using it! Other application can access user data stored by the web application if have admin privileges! |The client functionality and data is in the control of the application! The application knows what configuration in place! Other application cannot access, since operating system doesn't allow (sandbox) !|
|6|It uses its own language and files like JavaScript, VBScript, CSS, HTML, etc., rather than operating system language and files. This language is interpreter based (slower than compiler) | It only uses operating system language and operating system controlled files! It is fast since it is compiled.|
|7|The web browser by default doesn't provide no code software, but several vendors of the web application provides no code softwares that is different and making users to suffer|No code software comes with the application and ready to use.|
|8|It is not designed by default WYSIWYG, rather the web application need to take that step! Some web application will not be WYSIWYG! |Application designed by default WYSIWYG!|
|9|Web application is separate and native applicatin is separate|Merges native and web application into one native application running in all platforms. Can use it online and/or offline mode!|
|10|Some are done without user consent|Done always with user consent|
|11|Can only use most features of the hardware|Can use all the features of hardware|
|12|It complicates and delays things|It simplifies and makes things fast|

It is the new way for the application and documents! Hope developer recognise it! 

## Challenges and Solutions

| Serial Number | Challenges | Solutions |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
|1|To create a platform independent document that is exportable to any format the user feels.|Put the document view in a data model (JSON) and convert into platform specific document view. The view can be used to export into other document formats.|
|2|To make the document items reusable|Put the document items (text, photo, video, etc.,) in a document item document and allow it be accessible in the document. Not only words, we can reuse for example quotes, paragraphs, lines, words, documents, groups of paragraphs or photos, etc.,|
|3|To edit the document in WYSIWYG format|The document is following graph model and each nodes are represented as lines and each items in the nodes are represented as document items|
|4|Document saving should not be an issue if internet is gone|On each edit the document is saved no worries of saving!|
|5|To handle database without working in database directly|Manage data as document item and documents. Document is following a data model and can have complex data!|
|6|To add/change/remove components of the software dynamically|Human brain is a great example that adds and removes things dynamically. So designed a software brain to handle it. |
|7|To parse and validate document|Categorise each document item so that can identify it|
|8|To find documents that have one or more document items? For example to find food recipes that have tomato ingredient.|Categorise each document item so that can identify it while searching|
|9|Searching each document items and creating the document is slow|Document items are sorted as per a searching algorithm or stored in search engine database. When searching will be faster! Auto complete in iOS while typing works fastly and hence this also can be made fast |
|10|Have to create documents some times very fast|Disable the search and create document faster. Later parse the document and replace text with categorised document items! Until we use AI, prased document items needs confirmation from user! Auto complete in iOS while typing works fastly and hence this also can be made fast |
|11|Need to reused one document in other document|Just refer one or more documents in other documents. If source changes target also changes! Not only words, we can reuse for example quotes, paragraphs, lines, words, documents, groups of paragraphs or photos, etc.,|
|12|Renaming a document item need to change in affected documents|A logic will automatically do this since there is a document reference put in each document item. |
|13|Need a way to search the documents and user interface options|All document names and option names are stored as document item document so easy to search|
|14|Need to update user interface dynamically from any device|All the user interface elements are represented as document item documents. You update in any device since document view is platform independent!|
|15|Need to have no code features|All user interface elements are represented as documents and each functions of the software are accessible through REST web service. Can easily do no code features!|
|16|Need to represent complex document models like vector diagrams, 3D diagrams, etc.,?|Currently document uses graph model to represent simple document. Later can use any model to implement whatever the user desires!|
|17|Need to represent the interactive elements of a document. For example in school subject training|Since a vector document can be embedded in a document, we can put any complex interactive elements! |
|18|Need to be secure|Web service is secured using SSL. Each input parameters are validated and frequeny attacks are blocked! |
|19|Need to handle enough number of users without affecting performance|Since the server software represents a software brain, we can have as many of them to handle traffic! Each brain can handle only specific numbers of requests at a time! |
|20|Need a way so that Robot can manage the software and its documents. For example to add/change/remove things. Can also be used by IoT devices and applications.|Since the software is accessible through REST web service and all of them are represented as documents using document items it is easily manageable by Robots on the fly!|
|21|Use AI to provide intelligence|Since all the document items in the document are categorised it is easy to process it and provide intelligence! |
|22|Ability to move the user interface from 2D to 3D for AR / VR|Each user interface item are created taking into 3D in consideration|
|23|To work in offline and/or online|Since the brain is available in both client and server. So when internet is not available can work in offline and make it online later on! Note: client cannot hold all the neurons of a brain! |
|24|The document can be used to do presentation without duplicating the content in another presentation document. It can be converted to video.|Since document is following a model we can do presentation without duplicates! Text to speech can be used to generate audio and document can generate images! Since text to speech is used the trainings can be done in any language the user desires, but exisitng video recording doesn't provide that benefit since once recorded difficult to modify for other languages! Just need images and audios to create a video.|
|25|Can i represent a document or book or application library? So that can represent entire world knowledge!|The document map is organised using Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) used in libraries and has the 10 main classes for the entire world knowledge! Each main class is further structured into ten hierarchical divisions, each having ten sections of increasing specificity. Put all application and documents in the library! Can be easily searched and located!|

## What is a No Code Software?

No code software is a shift in how users interface with software tools! No need to know any programming language! All are visual and human friendly! Only need few no code software companies! Software developers realise the transition! Don’t waste your time and energy in programming langauges that is not useful!

10. charts for data visualisation

## UI interfaces

1. document map - graphically access documents
2. option map - all the options are displayed through this
3. toolbar
4. object controller
5. document editor

## In progress / to do / done things

1. making every user interface editable using document
2. If a title of a document renames all the refered places renames
3. if a document item name changes then all refered document renames
4. Import one or more lines from a web page or a document as a document items
5. Import a CSV file to create document items
6. import a csv or excel file to create document item and detail document
7. Make the search process fast by indexing the document items
8. Make the documents presentable in presentation mode. This presentation will look like a video! Handles presentation in any language, where as a video done by Udemy is handling only one language! Even can generate video from set of documents (https://github.com/dev-labs-bg/swift-video-generator)! The text in the document are spoken by Text-To-speech by google api! Some words can be technical and not english (for example: "xcodeproj" can be said as "x code project") and to pronounce correctly we have to change pronounciation based on document type! The text in the document are translated using google translate api! In future text-to-speech can immitate each individual and no need actual human! Robots will train us and humans just learn! The presentation document will be generated on the fly from main document or can use templates to refer the main! Don't duplicate things in presentation document and difficult to maintain!
9. The user can search what documents are using a specific document item. For example in food recipe documents the user can search for an ingredient docuemnt item!
10. The new text added is automatically categorised in to grammar item based on oxford dictionary api
11. Ability to see a graphical representation of a document item. For example you can know a fruit or vegetable belong to which species or family! It will show a graph to explain!
12. Move most collections to the document graph model instead of json in mongodb! This includes document, human profile, company profile, application profile, user name password authentication, security token pin, email pin verification, mailjet parameters, etc., If we move it is easy to manage from the device itslef instead of going to database!
13. import one or more photos as document items using the file name as the photo name
14. Import document items by scannig image through OCR or taking photo from video and use OCR. Can use machine learning
15. Can capture information like human on the fly in the videos to add document items
16. While adding new text in document it can be categorised by allowing user to search categories and then add to that category or create new categories and add to that!
17. The texts are in default format! Each level is following a colour! We can add formating to each ui controls to make it beautiful!
18. Ability to collapse/expand graph nodes
19. Ability to cut/copy/paste through server or client
20. Ability to find and replace
21. Ability to redo or undo
22. A document or part of document can be imported in a document. On change at source changes in target also (Reference)

## Brain functions

1. Neurons can be moved to client or server as the user desires, while building the project! A client cannot hold all the neurons in that case server has those neurons! If the neurons are in client can do offline things! If neuron is in server can do online things! Same neuron code is used for client and server! Server is a web service!
2. All the neurons can access the data using a single database server
3. We can have one or more duplicate brains to handle large number of users, but accessing single database server or separate database server
4. We can view what neurons are executing in a brain
5. Since neuron accept single input all the input data can be validate before using
6. Need to explore options like "What if a neuron fails and the server stops?". Can use XPC mechanisms in swift! 
7. Need to explore options to remove/add/update neuron from client or server dynamically without building application. XPC mechanism?

## Known issues

1. The udcdocument is not changing the document name when document title is changed. Also the language title is not changing!
2. Some document items are not in natural order
3. Some other issues are randomly coming need to resolve
4. Due to database issue application is not running properly. It is resolvable!

## Some documents you can view in document map (the left view. search by typing in search bar) to check how document items look like

1. food ingredient
2. food ingredient unit
3. grammar
4. country
5. volume unit
6. temperature unit
7. gas stove mark etc.,

Some document items are not linked to document map yet so you need to use the document id in udcdocument and put manually in view code to view it!

## Future prospects

1. No code software - For this to happen we need to automate the whole application and make it programmable from client device itself! Application already designed to be no code software in future!
2. Document as a service (Daas) - Used to modify a document from a device. For example plant IoT device residing in home. The univese docs brain will run in Linux and will be running in users home.
3. Interactive education books - needs vector drawing document, source code document, training document
4. Printable books that can be sold - Need to follow some templates
5. Add more platforms like Windows 10, Android, Linux, etc., since only view is changing. Funcitonality remains same. Since functionality is written in swift only swift supporting platforms can have offline functionality! This also can change since Swift programming language is now written for more operating systems like windows 10, amazon linux, centos, etc., So the nueron code can reside in both client and server for all operating system so one code can serve for all!

## Objectives

1. To make everything manageable in device itself using documents. User no need to manage database or deployment server!
2. I will not use web application for this since it creates suffering! Native application is the natural thing that takes care of the user! We have lots of duplicate operating system, programming languages, etc., it is not good and we need to support a single one! If we support single one we can cooperate and make it better for whole humanity! But still nobody can stop from developing it in Web (this software can do that also), due to the freedom it gives! Even though we have freedom there are so many other problems that causes web application in browser to be waste of time and energy!
