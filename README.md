Universe Documents (Universe Docs) (I've started this project from October 2018)

This project is partially done! Once completed it will benefit! 

## Introduction 

Each document items in the document are searchable and added to the document! The document items are categorised hierarchially for easier understanding! It allows to create applications using set of documents! Document item search can be enabled or disabled! This application gathers data like human! Humans in brain they used to categorise informations they perceive and while writing a document or expressing things they use the categorised information in mind (document items)!

A Document item can be a text, photo, video, animation, button, link, upload document, download document or share button!If you tap or click a document item in document then other items of the same category shows and you can change it! If you click a photo other photos of same category shows up!

Universe docs brain is a web service that generates the view for the document, based on the device! The view is displayed in the client app "Universe Docs". The client app can be running in any platform the user desires! The view model is platform independent! Universe docs brain is nothing but set of neurons that is doing specific tasks!

## Screen Diagrams

[Document Item Document](universedocs.github.com/Universe-Docs/document item document.jpg)

## Looks like a disadvantage but not like that

1. Since each document item or text is searched and added to the document, it will be slow. Our brain is designed to handle things slowly and it is better to do things slowly! We humans do everything fast and is a problem! It doesn't mean it is designed to delay user, but we can disable search, make the search faster using search alogrithms, indexing, etc.,
2. We need to devote time to cateogrise document items of each document, but the time we spend for it benefits us later! Categorisation also can be done later (disable document item search) so that documents can be created in urgent cases! Since the document is categorised it is easy to understand. It is used to get details of each document item from document itself! Categorisation can be made fast by using human like information gathering technologies like image recognition, speech recognition, video recognition, sound recognition, information search, AI, ML, etc.,
3. Editing interface uses text box to move between document items! Can customise the view to look like well known document editiors! I don't have time to do this! 

## How it compares to Google docs, Apple pages, microsoft word?

1. Each item (text, photo,etc.,) in the document are categorised and easy to parse, validate, filter, remote access/modify! For example by robot which is learning a recipe and modifies the document!
2. Each item (text, photo,etc.,) in the document are categorised while document is created / pre categorised, and no need extra processing by natural language processing!
3. The document follows a model. Graph is used for now. Later it can include any other model!
4. For deleting/copying a line/word/sentence/node just invoke a command no need to highlight and do it!
5. Avoids duplicates. Reusable document items! 
6. Provides service to manipulate documents from remote. For example a robot can manipulate document from distance or through wireless communcation!
7. Easy to find detials of each document items like description, further details, translations, meaning, hierarchy, etc., from the document itself! That details can be filtered based on specific document type!
8. Brings all documents and applications in central place like a book library, that is easy to search, interact between them and access
9. The document items can be used as a thing for changing the text in document to other one easily

## Web Browser Vs Universe Docs

| Serial Number | Web Browser | Universe Docs |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
|1|It was designed in 1990 and 30 years as gone. Designed based on the knowledge at that time and not changed much! They don't want to change much so that past internet contents are not affected! No Innovation for 30 years to make it close to the operating system!|It can change as per new innovations and is working close with operating system|
|2|It does not use the UI of the operating system, rather uses the content of the window as UI (drawing canvas or form)! It cannot use the other UI elements of an operating system for example toolbar, status bar! UI is not standard and encourages to have different UI for same type of application thereby spoiling the user experience and understanding! So many clicking of back and forward buttons and it is not natural! |Uses the UI of the operating system and closely works with it. Standard UI for each type of application and is human friendly!|
|3|The UI is not purely object oriented, rather mix of template and object oriented. Real world objects are object oriented and it is the proper way! |Purely object oriented! UI objects are represented as JSON and is mapped to programming language objects! |
|4|Web browser is not designed securely by default. Each web browser is following its own way! Due to the vulnerabilities it is the popular way to attack user by hackers!|The application is designed taking security into consideration and is managed by single entity but developed in cooperation with all peoples! |
|5|The client functionality and data is closely tied to web browser and not application. So the user need to do two steps to be safe: log out application, clear the browser cache. The application and user don't know what web browser configuration is set that creates security issue to the user using it! Other application can access user data stored by the web application if have admin privileges! |The client functionality and data is in the control of the application! The application knows what configuration in place! Other application cannot access, since operating system doesn't allow (sandbox) !|
|6|It uses its own language and files like JavaScript, VBScript, CSS, HTML, etc., rather than operating system language and files. This language is interpreter based (slower than compiler) | It only uses operating system language and operating system controlled files! It is fast since it is compiled.|
|7|The web browser by default doesn't provide no code software, but several vendors of the web application provides no code softwares that is different and making users to suffer|No code software comes with the application and ready to use.|
|8|It is not designed by default WYSIWYG, rather the web application need to take that step! Some web application will not be WYSIWYG! |Application designed by default WYSIWYG!|
|9|Web application is separate and native applicatin is separate|Merges native and web application into one native application running in all platforms. Can use it online and/or offline mode!|
|10|Some are done without user consent|Done always with user consent|
|11|Can only use most features of the hardware|Can use all the features of hardware|
|12|It complicates and delays things|It simplifies and makes things fast|

It is the new way for the application and documents! Hope developer recognise it! 

## What is a No Code Software?

No code software is a shift in how users interface with software tools! No need to know any programming language! All are visual and human friendly! Only need few no code software companies! Software developers realise the transition! Donâ€™t waste your time and energy in programming langauges that is not useful! 

## In what industries it is used (NOTE: all industries using the Universe Docs documents to serve things)?
1. Education
2. Food
3. Software Development
4. Retail
5. Robotics
6. Smart things (using IoT)
7. Other industries (form filling, etc.,)
8. Data analytics
9. More can be there....

## What science and technologies it can use in future?
1. Artificial intelligence (AI)
2. ML (Machine Learning)
3. Robotics (regular, micro, nano)
4. Augment Reality (AR) / Virtual Reality (VR)
5. IoT

## What are the document types it can have?

1. Training document (can be any training document! For each training document there is a separate document type)
2. Food recipe document
3. Shopping list document (along with the food recipe handles food recipes)
4. Task document (used in software development)
5. ingredient document (contians all the ingredeints for a food recipe)
6. vector drawing document with event handling (Can be used for teaching. Can be used as board in school. Can be embedded in a interactive training document for home school. Document items can be searched and added into this document while teaching. Can use pencil to draw lines, rectangle and other shapes to explain things!)
7. shopping list, shoping item detail, checkout and payment gateway documents (use to shop anything)
8. personal page document (celebraties personal page, accessed through app link)
9. requirements document (used in software development)
10. design document (used in software development)
11. calendar document (used by software developers, individuals, etc.,) The calender can contain reference to food recipe, task, requirement, design, issue, alogrithm or any other type of document! Which allows users to plan one or more documents for a day or month or time or whatever!
12. issue document (used in software development)
13. algorithm document (used in software development. Extracts the comments from source code in hierarchial format so that user no need to see source code to understand the logic)
14. source code document ( can be embeedded in software trainings)

## UI controls

1. text
2. photo/video/animation
3. link (document, website, email, phone)
4. upload document (use in trainings to upload a home work document)
5. download document (used to download source codes for a software training)
6. share (facebook, twitter, instagram, etc.,)
7. table
8. graph (for adding nested contents in graphical format)
9. vector diagram (for embedding in school training books)
10. charts for data visualisation

## UI interfaces

1. document map - graphically access documents
2. option map - all the options are displayed through this
3. toolbar
4. object controller
5. document editor

## In progress / to do / done things

1. making every user interface editable using document
2. If a title of a document renames all the refered places renames
3. if a document item name changes then all refered document renames
4. Import one or more lines from a web page or a document as a document items
5. Import a CSV file to create document items
6. import a csv or excel file to create document item and detail document
7. Make the search process fast by indexing the document items
8. Make the documents presentable in presentation mode. This presentation will look like a video! Handles presentation in any language, where as a video done by Udemy is handling only one language! Even can generate video from set of documents (https://github.com/dev-labs-bg/swift-video-generator)! The text in the document are spoken by Text-To-speech by google api! Some words can be technical and not english (for example: "xcodeproj" can be said as "x code project") and to pronounce correctly we have to change pronounciation based on document type! The text in the document are translated using google translate api! In future text-to-speech can immitate each individual and no need actual human! Robots will train us and humans just learn! The presentation document will be generated on the fly from main document or can use templates to refer the main! Don't duplicate things in presentation document and difficult to maintain!
9. The user can search what documents are using a specific document item. For example in food recipe documents the user can search for an ingredient docuemnt item!
10. The new text added is automatically categorised in to grammar item based on oxford dictionary api
11. Ability to see a graphical representation of a document item. For example you can know a fruit or vegetable belong to which species or family! It will show a graph to explain!
12. Move most collections to the document graph model instead of json in mongodb! This includes document, human profile, company profile, application profile, user name password authentication, security token pin, email pin verification, mailjet parameters, etc., If we move it is easy to manage from the device itslef instead of going to database!
13. import one or more photos as document items using the file name as the photo name
14. Import document items by scannig image through OCR or taking photo from video and use OCR. Can use machine learning
15. Can capture information like human on the fly in the videos to add document items
16. While adding new text in document it can be categorised by allowing user to search categories and then add to that category or create new categories and add to that!
17. The texts are in default format! Each level is following a colour! We can add formating to each ui controls to make it beautiful!
18. Ability to collapse/expand graph nodes
19. Ability to cut/copy/paste through server or client
20. Ability to find and replace
21. Ability to redo or undo
22. A document or part of document can be imported in a document. On change at source changes in target also (Reference)

## Brain functions

1. Neurons can be moved to client or server as the user desires, while building the project! A client cannot hold all the neurons in that case server has those neurons! If the neurons are in client can do offline things! If neuron is in server can do online things! Same neuron code is used for client and server! Server is a web service!
2. All the neurons can access the data using a single database server
3. We can have one or more duplicate brains to handle large number of users, but accessing single database server or separate database server
4. We can view what neurons are executing in a brain
5. Since neuron accept single input all the input data can be validate before using
6. Need to explore options like "What if a neuron fails and the server stops?". Can use XPC mechanisms in swift! 
7. Need to explore options to remove/add/update neuron from client or server dynamically without building application. XPC mechanism?

## Known issues

1. The udcdocument is not changing the document name when document title is changed. Also the language title is not changing!
2. Some document items are not in natural order
3. Some other issues are randomly coming need to resolve
4. Due to database issue application is not running properly. It is resolvable!

## Some documents you can view in document map (the left view. search by typing in search bar) to check how document items look like

1. food ingredient
2. food ingredient unit
3. grammar
4. country
5. volume unit
6. temperature unit
7. gas stove mark etc.,

Some document items are not linked to document map yet so you need to use the document id in udcdocument and put manually in view code to view it!

## Future prospects

1. No code software - For this to happen we need to automate the whole application and make it programmable from client device itself! Application already designed to be no code software in future!
2. Document as a service (Daas) - Used to modify a document from a device. For example plant IoT device residing in home. The univese docs brain will run in Linux and will be running in users home.
3. Interactive education books - needs vector drawing document, source code document, training document
4. Printable books that can be sold - Need to follow some templates
5. Add more platforms like Windows 10, Android, Linux, etc., since only view is changing. Funcitonality remains same. Since functionality is written in swift only swift supporting platforms can have offline functionality! This also can change since Swift programming language is now written for more operating systems like windows 10, amazon linux, centos, etc., So the nueron code can reside in both client and server for all operating system so one code can serve for all!

## Objectives

1. To make everything manageable in device itself using documents. User no need to manage database or deployment server!
2. I will not use web application for this since it creates suffering! Native application is the natural thing that takes care of the user! We have lots of duplicate operating system, programming languages, etc., it is not good and we need to support a single one! If we support single one we can cooperate and make it better for whole humanity! But still nobody can stop from developing it in Web (this software can do that also), due to the freedom it gives! Even though we have freedom there are so many other problems that causes web application in browser to be waste of time and energy!

4. Deployment Server: Mac/Ubuntu (Linux). Linux support need to be done! 

Enough experience on the above so that can handle full development life cycle (R&D, analysis, design, development, testing)

This project is big and serves all of humanity if completed successfully! It is a WYSIWYG document editor, no code software, application store, document as a service, data repository, training tool, book library! It will need enough time, human resources and human expertise to complete this project on time! The developer as to use the software of this project in their daily lives so that is usable and of hight quality! 

This projects can have deadlines, but make sure at later point of time it is having missed things that is not taken due to deadlines! Keep track of those missed things, postponed date and the reason for its delay! 

Once released we can share the profit! 

I will participate in it as much as possible, since this is a parallel work apart from my daily works! My daily work is having higher priority! Once this project is developed enough and it is useful, it will be moved as a high priority work!
